## Relaxed Sneak Animations

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37260

**Summary:** Sneaking animations with a raised center of gravity, straighter posture with arms reeled in and no bent wrists.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (No issues in 2.4.0 after re-running FNIS.)

**Recommendations:** 
* @chosti-factor (Highly Recommend)
  * Sneak animations are much more natural. Followers look like they are sneaking, not squatting for other purposes...

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* @chosti-factor (LS2 version 2.4.0)
  * Install "Relaxed Sneak Animations" mod after "Pretty Combat Animations" in the left pane

**Extra Notes:**

Don't forget to re-run FNIS.
