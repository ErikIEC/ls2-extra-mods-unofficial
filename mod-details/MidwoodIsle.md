## Midwood Isle SE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120

**Summary:** New land mod with multiple quests

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no serious issues after patch, a few textures with serious lag and some that seemed to be missing entirely, may just need better patching or CK attention)

**Recommendations:**

* JaxomofRuatha (Okay)
  * The mod itself is incredibly well done for the most part, with the exception of a few iffy voice acting parts, but it feels extremely "vanilla" in a not great way. I definitely wouldn't do the full exploration again, though the main quest is decent (again, feels very "vanilla" Elder Scrolls)

**Official Patches:**
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120 (CBBE Plated Robes, Dangerous NPCs Patch, Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch, Lights control by Tarlazo, Solitude ship alternative location 2 patch)

**Custom Patches:**
* [JOR - Midwood Isle SE / USSEP Patch](custom-patches/JOR_MidwoodIsle_USSEP_Patch.esp.esp)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * Currently Midwood Isle.esp and MI Alt Ship Loc 2.esp are before SkyUI_SE.esp
  * DBM_MidwoodIsle_Patch.esp is before ai overhaul patch.esp
  * Dangerous NPCs MI Patch.esp and MILightsControl.esp are likely okay anywhere, currently after Occlusion.esp
