## Cheesemod for EVERYONE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506

**Summary:** Adds a huge amount of hand-placed cheeses and a quest with Sheogorath

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Patches exist for PCE and JK's interiors, but there were enough conflicts that I wasn't comfortable adding it without checking the Placed Item records (since getting through most of them would be incredibly frustrating if you couldn't finish)
