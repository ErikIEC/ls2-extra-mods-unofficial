## The Shadow of Meresis

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38167

**Summary:** The Shadow of Meresis adds "an extensive quest, leading you to various places all over Skyrim. In addition to new locations and dungeons you'll meet new NPCs with more than 200 fully voiced lines of dialogue spoken by three actors. The playtime is about two to three hours."

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no stability issues known, tested by @chosti-factor with LS 2.4.0)

**Recommendations:** 
* @chosti-factor (Highly Recommend)
  * Short but fun. Good voice acting and original quests made an enjoyable addition to my playthrough.

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
* [Chosti - Meresis / LS2 Patch](/custom-patches/LS2%20Meresi%20Patch.esp)
  * @chosti-factor: Has minor conflicts with the Brotherhood of Old and Palaces and Castles Enhanced. The custom patch removes objects placed by Shadow of Meresis that block the entrance to the Fringe Sanctum (Brotherhood of Old). The patch also resolves an NPC placement conflict with PCE.

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* @chosti-factor (LS2 version 2.4.0), JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.0)
  * Load `Shadow of Meresis.esp` before `The Brotherhood of Old.esp`, and `LS2 Meresi Patch.esp` before `ELE_SSE.esp`

**Extra Notes:**

Unless you look for it, the quest won't start. There is a corpse in a mini-island across the Solitude sawmill. It's hard to find because of Living Skyrim's tall grasses, but it's there. Loot the corpse and wear the amulet to start the quest. From the mod page: The quest starts at the Solitude Sawmill (south of Katla's Farm) where you will find a corpse on a little sandbank in the middle of the river.
