**Summary:** 

From the Valley of Outcasts mod page: A freeform adventure centered around a large citadel in the Jerall Mountains. Over 1000 lines of voiced Dialogue and 12 quests oriented for all playstyles and made to integrate well with the base game.

From the Last Refuge mod page: The sequel to Valley of Outcasts, a year in the making. Go on an epic adventure to stop a powerful Lich from obtaining an Elder Scroll. Over 1200 lines of high-quality voice over, 9 major quests, and hours of new content.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** 

@chosti-factor: I played about 3 hours of Part 1 without any major issues. Consoled-started Part 2 and played about 1 hour without any major issues. SSEEdit shows some conflicts, but most of those are intended. Part 2 needs to be installed alongside Part 1, even if you only intend to play Part 1, as the bugfixes have been incorporated into Part 2.

@JaxomofRuatha: Some small conflicts, but looked okay in game, did not seem to have stability issues

**Recommendations:** 

* @chosti-factor (Okay)
  * This mod adds content and a new area to build structures (similar to Blackthorn). As you build structures, quests become available. Quests and voice acting are of varying quality. Part 1 has some references to other games that may break the immersion for some (I found them funny because I'm a child). You have to talk to NPCs to get the quests. Quest markers can be a little iffy.

**Official Patches:**
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18175 (Blackface Fixer 2 (essential), Immersive Start (recommended but optional))

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**CLEANING REQUIRED:**
* JerralMountainsCitadel.esm
* JerralMountainsCitadelPart1.esm 

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* @JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.0), @chosti-factor (LS2 version 2.4.0)
  * Install "Valley of Outcasts" first, then "The Last Refuge", then the two patches.
  * Load `JerralMountainsCitadel.esm`, `JerralMountainsCitadelPart1.esm`, and `JerralMountainsCitadelPart2.esm` in that order after `More Gifts For Children.esl`
  * Load `JMCImmersiveStart.esp` anywhere after `JerralMountainsCitadelPart2.esm` and before `LS2 Patches Merged.esp`

**Extra Notes:**

@chosti-factor: Overall I think it's worth it to install, but it'll cost you 3 non-ESL slots (4 if you add the Immersive Start patch).
