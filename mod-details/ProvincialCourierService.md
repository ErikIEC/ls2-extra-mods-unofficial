**Summary:** Adds a home for the Courier near Whiterun

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** No stability issues, conflicted AI (custom patch is intended to forward AI packages, but was not able to do so without eliminating Courier visual overhaul from LS2...he currently just stands outside of the building instead of sandboxing correctly)

**Recommendations:** 
* JaxomofRuatha (Okay)
