**Summary:** Adds a new follower and quests related to her

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** There is a patch for OCW, and I made an experimental patch for Relighting Skyrim, but I had significant crashing issues due to the conflicts with the Hedge Mage Armor. It's possible that using the "no Worldspace edits" version of HMA will allow this to work.
