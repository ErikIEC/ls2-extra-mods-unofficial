## Volkihar Knight - Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38546

**Summary:** Adds a small display to LOTD's Hall of Secrets to house a set of the Volkihar Knight armor. 

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Unclear (no known issues, but since Volkihar Knight.esp is currently in Armors Merged.esp, I currently have just unhidden the non-merged plugin, but feel COMPLETELY FREE to skip this mod until it is properly integrated into LS)

**Recommendations:** 
_None_

**Official Patches:**
* [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980)
* [The Curator's Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38529)

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.4.0)
  * Unhide Volkihar Knight.esp (from Volkihar Knight - Vampire Armor mod), place before Audio Overhaul Skyrim.esp. This results in duplicate records, so it's possible that there are issues that will come up using this method, but seems stable at least.
  * DBM_VolkiharKnight_Patch.esp and LOTD_TCC_Volkihar.esp in that order, currently before ELE_SSE.esp (NOTE: I reinstalled the Legacy of the Dragonborn Official Patches and Legacy of the Dragonborn SSE - The Curators Companion with different names and no other patches enabled to get these)
