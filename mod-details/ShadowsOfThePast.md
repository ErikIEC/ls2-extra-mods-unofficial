## Shadows of the Past SSE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4564

**Summary:** A Tribute to TESIV Oblivion. Adds a fully voiced questline with 6 quests and and various new dungeons to the game. Queststart: go in a city or village and let the courier approach you.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no stability issues known, tested by @chosti-factor with LS 2.4.0)

**Recommendations:** 
* @chosti-factor (Highly Recommend)
  * On the short side, but fun. Voice acting is hit or miss. Environments added and quests are good quality.

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
* [Chosti - Shadows of the Past / LS2 Patch](/custom-patches/LS2%20-%20Shadows%20of%20the%20Past%20-%20Patch.esp)
  * @chosti-factor: The custom patch moves an entrance in one of the quests to get around the changes from JKs Skyrim. It also forwards navmesh records from Update.esm that seem to have been incorrectly missed.

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* @chosti-factor (LS2 version 2.4.0), JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.0)
  * Load `AKShadowsOfThePast.esm` after `More Gifts From Children.esl`, and load `LS2 Shadows of the Past.esp` before `ELE_SSE.esp`

**Extra Notes:**

To start the quest, go to any city and the courier will bring you a letter to start the first quest. Also, the main NPC won't always give you the second quest after completing the first one. If so, just save and reload and the NPC will then have the prompt available. From the mod page: quest 2 the Forgotten Prisoner sometimes refuses to start. It's a well known bug in questmods and easy to fix. After Herbert offered his merchant service save the game and reload.
