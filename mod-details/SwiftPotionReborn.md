## Swift Potion Reborn

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12293

**Summary:** An auto potion system with effect hotkeys!

Swift Potion Reborn is an auto potion system. When your Health/Magicka/Stamina reaches a level that you define as too low, a potion/food item will be used. A delay system will prevent potions from being used rapidly in succession. Effect hotkeys allow you to bind an effect to a single key and use any potion that has that effect.
