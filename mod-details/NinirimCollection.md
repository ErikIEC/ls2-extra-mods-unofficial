**Summary:** Adds a museum containing huge amounts of custom female armor for CBBE.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no issues after patching)

**Recommendations:** 
* WinterdrakeX (Highly Recommend)

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
* WIP - Needs to be patched for Occlusion and possibly Music Mods Merged, is stable without this (only changes are EditorIDs and MusicType records)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* WinterdrakeX (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * Install and move this mod upwards before the separator named "Items - Female Armors". It should only overwrite "unofficial performance optimized textures AKA (UPOT)". Let others overwrite it.
  * Put [Sunjeong] Ninirim Collection.esp a few mods before ELE_SSE.esp (apparently if you stick some mod right before ELE_SSE.esp it sometimes still overwrite ELE_SSE.esp).

**Extra Notes:**
* Credits for the outfits go to Ninirim for the countless years of work he's done. Included more specific credits in an in-game poster inside the museum.
