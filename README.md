Information about adding and testing mods for compatibility with Living Skyrim modlist

**IMPORTANT NOTE!!!**
This is a completely unofficial listing of mods that I and others from the Living Skyrim community have attempted to make work with the base Living Skyrim modlist. Adding ANY of these completely voids all support from ForgottenGlory and the Living Skyrim development team. Any custom patches are EXPERIMENTAL and load/install suggestions are ONLY SUGGESTIONS, using any of them is completely at your own risk.

I made this to collaborate on ideas, but it is entirely unofficial. You've been warned!

## Notes on how to use/contribute

**Recommendation ratings**

For the moment, I'm using the following rating system for any recommmendations:

1. Must-Add
2. Highly Recommended
3. Okay
4. Not Needed
5. Avoid

**Installing patches/individual files from existing LS2 mods**

For several patches and files, there is already a downloaded version with LS2, but the patches aren't selected for non-included mods. To add them without reinstalling over the original mod, do the following:

1. Select "Reinstall Mod..." from the mod in question
2. Rename the mod (can be anything as long as it's different, I recommend adding a description of the patch/file to the end of the name)
3. Only install the relevant files/patches you're trying to overwrite/add (if possible)
4. If the FOMOD doesn't allow for selecting only specific files/patches, finish installing and go to "Information..." on the mod. From there, it is possible under the "Filetree" tab to delete any unused files in the mod, so that the originals remain intact from the first installation

**Extra Notes**

Included NPCs in this patch are Golldir, Erandur, Vorstag, Madanach, Benor, Marcurio, Belrand, and Stenvar. The Men of Winter records were forwarded as is, so if there's changes in new LS releases, that might not be quite the same if there's customized patching.

# Mods Under Review

**These are mods that are known through reputation, interest, or prior attempts to integrate, and either haven't been correctly integrated/patched for LS2 yet or haven't had an attempt to add them**


## M'Rissi's Tails of Troubles SE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9666

**Summary:** Adds a new follower and quests related to her

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** There is a patch for OCW, and I made an experimental patch for Relighting Skyrim, but I had significant crashing issues due to the conflicts with the Hedge Mage Armor. It's possible that using the "no Worldspace edits" version of HMA will allow this to work.


## Cheesemod for EVERYONE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506

**Summary:** Adds a huge amount of hand-placed cheeses and a quest with Sheogorath

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Patches exist for PCE and JK's interiors, but there were enough conflicts that I wasn't comfortable adding it without checking the Placed Item records (since getting through most of them would be incredibly frustrating if you couldn't finish)
